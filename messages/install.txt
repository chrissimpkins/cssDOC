Hi there. You apparently have exceptionally good plugin taste.  Thanks for installing cssDOC!

ABOUT
-----

cssDOC allows you to view CSS documentation for text that you CSS elements that you select (or have your cursor located in/near) in your Sublime Text editor. If cssDOC recognizes the text as a CSS element, you get the Mozilla developer network documentation page for it.  If not, cssDOC sends you to a CSS filtered search on the Mozilla developer network site (when you select the text, not on 'hover' match attempts on the text surrounding your cursor).

If you have problems, check the status bar and the console for error messages.

USAGE
-----

  1 ) Right Click Menu - select or locate cursor in the CSS element and use 'CSS Doc Search' in the right click menu
  2 ) Keybinding - select or locate cursor in the CSS element and use the keys: 'Ctrl-Alt-c'
  3 ) Command Palette - open the command palette (Cmd-Shift-P or Ctrl-Shift-P) and enter 'cssdoc', then select menu item
